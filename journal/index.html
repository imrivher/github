                        As designers, our top priority is to make sure that our designs for user experience are never obtrusive. A problem you can often run into is getting too excited after learning a new technique. While learning new ways of presenting information is exciting, we must make sure to not get caught up in the moment, and to think through if we even need them in the first place.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However I do have one problem with this article. That being that it focuses too much on commercial uses of overlays (subscriptions, info forms, advertisements, etc.). I think there are plenty of other potential ways of using overlays, such as having a small box with basic information, and being able to expand it into a larger overlay with detailed information.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall I think that overlays can be very useful in enhancing the user experience of our designs. But it is vital to keep in mind the who, what, when, where, and why we are using them. If you cannot justify your use of overlays over another method of displaying information, then maybe hold off on adding more.

                        I don’t frequently use websites with forms beyond a search bar. The website I chose is the UC Davis login site, logins can be annoying, but the simple yet visually interesting design of the page makes it bearable to login every day.

                        <h2>Best Practices: Forms</h2>

                    <p>
                        Forms can often be infuriating to use. Even though they are the main form of agency for the user, a form can often be the final straw for a given website. This is why it is so crucial to exercise caution when designing them. This reading is very useful to keep in mind for this purpose.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One important thing I took away from this reading was the sense of hierarchy, or a ‘hook’. When we design a poster, we create something big, flashy, high contrast, or otherwise attention grabbing. This provides the viewer with an easy ‘in’ to the design, and once you have their attention, then you can move on to the rest. The same principle applies to forms, you want to provide your user with easy questions first to give them their in. Then once you have them, you can slowly move to the more difficult questions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Something I also think is vital for us to keep in mind is to not let aesthetics get in the way of usability. While often designers have a clear vision for their designs, sometimes they can make the user experience miserable by focusing solely on the visual design. It is important to make sure your design is easy to work through, or else you will inevitably lose your users.
